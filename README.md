Database of books with user profiles

This program allows the user to create an account, log in, checkout and return books within the database. If the user has admin access, they can add/remove books from the database.

##Known Bugs
1. Accounts don't log in even though there is an object file in users directory.
2. Removing books with quantity of 2 can cause the book to stay in the borrow tab but still transfer to the available tab.

##Future
I need to add a return date for the borrowed books, if the book is not returned, the user will be fined, incrementing everyday.
